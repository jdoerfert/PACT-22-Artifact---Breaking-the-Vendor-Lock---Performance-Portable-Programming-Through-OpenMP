The SYCL port of the miniFE is based on the OpenMP4.5-opt.  By default, we use the SYCL GPU selector to run the application on a GPU. The source files Vector_functions.hpp and SparseMatrix_functions.hpp contain the kernel implementations. 

Verification
Verification is always enabled by commenting "if (params.verify_solution > 0)" in driver.hpp.

Debugging
Debugging can be enabled by adding the option -DMINIFE_DEBUG in Makefile


Build miniFE:
   make

Clean miniFE
   make realclean

Quick run 
  ./miniFE.x

The performance results are collected using the dimensions (128,128,128) :
  ./miniFE.x -nx 128 -ny 128 -nz 128
